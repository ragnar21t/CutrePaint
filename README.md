CutrePaint is only a testing WPF Application. I wanted to do something simple but at the same time challenging.

## Installation

Really there's nothing to install, check [Releases](https://github.com/ragnar21t/CutrePaint/releases) and download the .exe

# v 0.2 Features:

* Drawing Squares
  * Setting their sizes and color
  * Line Thickness
* Moving Squares
* Clearing the canvas
