# CutrePaint

![CutrePaintGUI](https://imgur.com/eyuGw80.png)

CutrePaint is only a testing WPF Application. I wanted to do something simple but at the same time challenging.

Cutre means "shabby" in Spanish.

## _Features_

* Draw Rectangle
  * You can specify its height, width and line thickness

__Planning to add__ :

* Draw with a 'pencil' like in Paint
* Change Rectangle Fill Color
* Support for adding Images

And more...

## Installation

Really there's nothing to install, check [Releases](https://github.com/ragnar21t/CutrePaint/releases) and download the .exe
