# CutrePaint

CutrePaint is only a testing WPF Application. I wanted to do something simple but at the same time challenging.

Cutre means "shabby" in Spanish.

__Built With__

For this project I've used the WPF .NET Framework

## Installation

Really there's nothing to install, check [Releases](https://github.com/ragnar21t/CutrePaint/releases) and download the .exe
